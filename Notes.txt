Basics first
TOUCH SCREEN COMPATIBLE
Might need client/server architecture
	Players/bank send requests to DB server
	Might be hard to keep updated
	But may not be able to share state otherwise
Leave breadcrumbs for later addition of logging
	e.g. whenever a player or the bank changes the DB
	just says "placeholder, add log entry here later"
	Maybe sooner rather than later?
Main page has you enter a name
Also need a (protected somehow) reset button to clear DB for new game
Entering the name initialises you in the DB, and redirects to a page with your name
Router routes named pages to the same name in the DB
	Protected from refresh/accidental close
navigating to a non-existent page redir to main

Players have associated objects:
Harbours (actually make object later), resources (5+gold)
Discard functionality (for over 7, placeholder for spending)
Player pages need to reload state
	See if I can have UseEffect update based on DB

Master page for bank
To start with, add resources to players from list of active users
May not have to update page state (except for game log)
	actual DB handles data (+/-)
	only players need to see resource numbers

More advanced: 
Add harbours to players - display little emblems somewhere on the page
Add a resource-swapping menu
	make a button for each resource 
	with default as x4
	changes automatically as harbours added
	Light up if player has enough resources
	Tapping it trades that many of the resource for a gold
Any time the player gets gold, popup to choose what to turn it into
Spending buttons - automatically subtract resources needed for a purchase
Add trading between players
Robber functionality - stealing
Automatic resource allocation after roll
	Either hex-based or settlement-based
	Hex-based, easier for robber functionality
	settlement-based might be cleaner looking
Robber functionality - block resource
Game log submenu for bank
	Player got X resources
	Player spent X, got Y
	Filter by player
	Actually has to refresh state often
